# **Why Airbnb**

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.dgtlnk.com/wp-content/uploads/airbnb_logo_detail.jpg")
```

## **Background**

Airbnb is a mobile/web platform that acts as a marketplace for vacationers to rent out other people's homes. The app allows everyday people to get involved with the home rentral market. In addition, Airbnb has alleviated much of the headache of trying to find an alternative to hotel rooms. 

## **Why Airbnb**

I chose Airbnb beacuse of my growing interest in the real estate market and real estate investing. While becoming a host for Airbnb is not one of my immediate goals, I was interested in metrics relating to the Hosts decision making process of joining Airbnb. What factors should a prospective Airbnb host consider before joining? 

Some questions I seek to explore involve: **A)** The pricing of a lisiting **B)** Factors that drive the listing's ratings **C)** Geographic differences in general Airbnb trends **D)** When should a host join

## **Terminology**

**Listing** : A property that can be rented through the Airbnb platform

**Host** : Someone who utilizes the Airbnb platform to rent out their property (listing).


# **The Data**

To answer my questions about Airbnb, I needed a dataset that contains metrics beyond the sticker price of each Airbnb property. Luckily, I found a website, [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/index.html) that provides Airbnb datasets for cities across the world. Inside Airbnb periodically scrapes data from the Airbnb website to update their data for each city.

## Getting / Picking Data

Inside Airbnb offered downloadable csv files for 28 locales across the United States. Because each csv file ranged from 20 to 100mb, I selected the top 11 cities by population size in the United States. I also threw in Hawaii as a relative measure of any extreme geographic differences reflected in Airbnb trends.

Each csv was manually uploaded and scraped and finally merged together to create one master list of every property across my selected locales.

## Wrangling

After merging all the individual city csv files together, I had about 85 variables (columns) to choose from. Much of the wrangling I did involved:

* Changing the variable types from `chr` to `num` 
* Refactoring variables of type: `Date`
* Converting percentages to decimals
* Renaming columns and summarizing counts for different categories.

Once cleaning was done, I created two primary data sets for my plots: `all_listings.csv` and `all_hosts.csv`.
For `all_listings.csv`, each row represents and individual Airbnb listig. For `all_hosts.csv`, each row represents a unique Airbnb host.


# **Describing and Naming Your Airbnb**

The following section utilizes the `wordcloud` package to generate graphics relating to the frequency in which Airbnb buzz words appear in listing descriptions and names. In addition, word frequency bar charts are also generated as another means of comparing the frequencies of the most popular words in Airbnb Listing names and descriptions.

* Listing Description: set of words used to describe an Airbnb Listing
* Listing Name: set of words used as the name of the Airbnb Listing

Part of being a successful Airbnb Host depends on your ability to persuade users to select your house over dozesn of similar options. Whether it be through fancy photos or a vast menu of amenities, hosts also seem to focus on utilizing key buzz words to grab Airbnb users' attention. 


## **Word Clouds** {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

**Method:** In order to prepare my data for the wordcloud creation, I utilized the `tm` package to wrangle my data and create a data frame with all the words utilized in the airbnb listings descriptions and names. 

Because I already had columns (listing_name, listing_description) in my bulk dataset `all_listings` that provide the description and name for every unique airbnb property, the `tm` package made it very easy to prepare a simple data frame with every word in the listing_name and listing_description columns and their respective frequencies.

```{r Word Cloud Prep, include = FALSE}
description_words <- read_csv("description_words.csv")
name_words <- read_csv("name_words.csv")
```

### Listing Name
```{r Listing Name Word Cloud, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.2, fig.align='left'}
# Set wordcloud seed for consistency
set.seed(50)

# Create wordcloud
wordcloud(words = name_words$word,
          freq = name_words$freq,
          min.freq = 1, 
          max.words=70, 
          random.order=FALSE, 
          rot.per=0.3,          
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
```

**Takeaways:** The wordclouds are compiled by taking the most frequent words in the Airbnb Listing Names and Descriptions. As indicated by the graphic, some key words that many current Airbnb hosts utilize include "Private", "Bedroom", "Spacious" "Home".

A quick glance at the wordcloud shows that many of the words used for the Airbnb Listing name seem to serve a couple primary purposes: 
* Describe the physical location
* Describe the type of property

Many of the words serve as adjectives describing the house such as "charming", "Beautiful", "Gorgeous". In addition, we also seem to have many words that describe the type of property that the host is advertising: "Apartment", "Oceanfront", "Modern", "Suite", "Studio".

### Listing Description
```{r Listing Description Word Cloud, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.2, fig.align='left'}
# Set wordcloud seed for consistency
set.seed(50)

# Create wordcloud
wordcloud(words = description_words$word,
          freq = description_words$freq,
          min.freq = 1, 
          max.words=70, 
          random.order=FALSE, 
          rot.per=0.1,            
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
```

**Takeaways:** The wordclouds are compiled by taking the most frequent words in the Airbnb Listing Names and Descriptions. As indicated by the graphic, some key words that many current Airbnb hosts utilize include "Private", "Bedroom", "Spacious" "Home".

## **Word Barcharts** {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

**Method** Along with the `ggplot2` package, I utilized the same dataframes created by my wordcloud wrangling to create barcharts of the top 10 occuring words in the Airbnb Listing Name and Description. 

```{r Word Barchart Prep, include = FALSE}
name_freq <- name_words[order(-name_words$freq),] %>%
  top_n(10)
desc_freq <- description_words[order(-description_words$freq),] %>%
  top_n(10)
```

### Listing Name
```{r Listing Name Bar Chart, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 3.5}
# Create plot object
name_bar <- ggplot(data = name_freq, aes(x=reorder(word, freq), y=freq, fill = word)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() + 
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("Frequency") + 
  ggtitle("Listing Name - Word Frequency")
  
# Print plot
name_bar
```

**Takeaways:** For the Listing Name bar chart, we can see that the most commonly used word is "Private" From personal experience, I remember that one of my search criteria in looking for an Airbnb to stay at was that the property is for myself and only myself. The keyword "Private" is most likely used in the Airbnb Listing Name so that users can quickly assess if the property will be for their use only.

The "Private" distinction may serve to be very important since Airbnb Hosts want to effectively communicate what type of property a user may be inquiring for. It would be very frustrating for users if they were to discover that their airbnb of interest was not "Private" later rather than earlier in their booking process.

### Listing Description
```{r Listing Description Bar Chart, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 3.5}
# Create plot object
desc_bar <- ggplot(data = desc_freq, aes(x=reorder(word, freq), y=freq, fill = word)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() + 
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("Frequency") + 
  ggtitle("Listing Description - Word Frequency")

# Print plot

```

# **Trends in Airbnb Hosts**

This section strives to identify key variables regarding Airbnb Hosts that ultimately drive their success. While exploring the dataset from InsideAirbnb, I found a vast array of variables that could be used to explore Airbnb Host qualities. These variables include:

* `host_since`: Date when host joined
* `host_response_proportion`: Proportion of booking messages that the Host responds too
* `host_acceptance_proportion`: Proportion of booking requests that the Host accepts
* `host_lisings_count_total`: Number of Listings Host owns

Let's consider the perspective of an Airbnb Host. What qualities of the Airbnb Hosts matter most in terms of generating high rates of bookings for their properties (Acceptance Rate)? Is there a certain time in which a host should join? What external factors should the host consider? Should I get more Airbnb properties? 

The following plots do not answer the questions above but attempt to add direction.


## **When Should I Join**

**Host Joining Rates by Month**

**Method:** The downloaded csvs from InsideAirbnb included the `host_since` variable which was later manipulated to truncate the day and year of the supplied Date, `month_host_joined`. The barchart was created with `ggplot`.

```{r When Should I Join Prep, include = FALSE}
# Create data frame with counts of hosts joining each month
month_counts <- data.frame(table(all_hosts$month_host_joined))
```

```{r Month_Joined Barchart, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 3.5}
# Create bar chart object
month_bar <- ggplot(data = month_counts, aes(x=Var1, y=Freq, fill = Var1)) +
  geom_col() + 
  xlab("Month Joined") +
  ylab("# of Hosts Joined") + 
  ggtitle("# of Hosts Joined by Month") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# Print bar chart
month_bar
```

**Takeaways:** While the distribution is largely unimodal, it seems like there is an influx of hosts joining in the months of May through August. A possible explanation for this distribution could be attributed to the seasonality of Airbnb profitablity. It is possible that Airbnbs are largely booked in the summer do to better vacation conditions and warmer weather. With this in mind, Hosts would be inclined to join Airbnb in the same period in which booking is at its peak to seek immediate profit.  

A further analysis of the seasonality of Airbnb hosts joining could include isolating the locations of the Airbnb hosts so that geographical effects are controlled for. 

## **Consider the Housing Market**

**Hosts Joining Rates by Year**

**Method:** The Time series for the Number of Hosts joined was constructed by grouping hosts by the year in which they joined (Truncating Day and Month from the `host_since` variable). 

The Housing Index Time Series is a generalized plotting of the S&P Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. The Case-Shiller index measures the changes in the prices of single-family homes within the United States. The Housing Index $ values are the market closing index price on the last trading day of each year.

```{r Yearly Join Prep, include = FALSE}
# Read in necessary csvs
index_housing <- read_csv("housing_index.csv")

# Pull vars
year_joined <- all_hosts %>%
  select(host_since, id_host)

# Reformat to just year
year_joined$host_since <- format(year_joined$host_since,"%Y")

# Count joiners for each year
year_summary <- data.frame(table(year_joined$host_since)) %>%
  rename("year" = Var1)

# Prep housing index data
index <- index_housing %>%
  mutate(year = as.factor(date))

combined <- merge(year_summary, index, by ="year") %>%
  select(-date)

coeff <- max(combined$value)/max(combined$Freq)
```

```{r Yearly Join Housing Index Plot, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 3.5}
# Create plot object
host_since_plot <- ggplot(combined, aes(x = year, group = 1)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = Freq), col = "red") + 
  geom_point(aes(y = value / coeff), col = "blue") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Number of Hosts Joined",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~.*coeff, name = "Housing Index $") 
  ) + 
  xlab("Year") +
  theme(
    axis.title.y = element_text(color = "red"),
    axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = "blue")
  ) + 
  ggtitle("Host Joining & Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index by Year")

# Print plot object
host_since_plot
```

**Takeaways:** I plotted the number of hosts joining each year against the Case-Shiller index to see if there were any signs of the housing market influencing airbnb hosts and prospective joiners. The double time series shows that as the Housing Index price increases sharply from 2017 on, the Number of Hosts joining decreases sharply. Maybe as the general price for homes increases, the number of prospective airbnb hosts decreases as the profitibality of home investing decreases. 

## **Please Respond**

**Acceptance Rate vs Response Rate**

**Method:** All Percentage variables from the initial dataset were converted to decimals so that they could be used as continous variables. This was particularly important for scatterplots. The plot was created using `geom_hex` bins to represent the density of the points occuring in bin's region. I chose to use this over the typical scatter plot because points are scattered across the entire graph; therefore, the density of points would better represent any trends across the graph.

```{r Acc Rate vs Resp Rate Prep, include = FALSE}
# Pull needed vars
hosts_scatter <- all_hosts %>%
  select(id_host,
         host_response_proportion,
         host_acceptance_proportion,
         locale,
         host_listings_count_total) 
```

```{r Acc Rate vs Resp Rate Scatterplot, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 3.5}
# Create plot object
acc_res_scatter <- ggplot(hosts_scatter, aes(x=host_response_proportion, y=host_acceptance_proportion)) +
  geom_hex(bins = 20,alpha = 0.9) + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(low="yellow",high="red") + 
  xlab("Host Response Rate") + 
  ylab("Host Acceptance Rate") + 
  ggtitle("Acceptance Rate vs Response Rate") +
  labs(fill = "# of Hosts")

# Print Object
acc_res_scatter
```

**Takeaways:** It is clear that the greatest number of hosts seem to have a Host response rate close to 1 and a Acceptance rate of 1. Does this indicate that "responsive" hosts are more likely to successfully accept a booking request? While we can see that hosts exhibit response rates and acceptance rates anywhere from 0 to 1, but the majority of hosts seem to have high acceptance and response rates. Prospective hosts may have to consider how responsive they have to be in order to increase the booking acceptance rates.

## **Is More Better**

**Acceptance Rate vs Number of Listings**

**Method:** Simple `ggplot` scatterplot with two continous variables: `host_acceptance_proportion` and `host_listings_count_total`

```{r Acc Rate vs Listings Count Prep, include = FALSE}
# Prep data frame: convert id_host to factor var
hosts_scatter_b <- hosts_scatter %>%
  mutate(host_id = as.factor(id_host))
  filter(hosts_scatter, host_listings_count_total > 10)
```

```{r Acc Rate vs Listings Count Scatterplot, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 3.5}
# Create plot object
acc_listings_scatter <- ggplot(hosts_scatter_b, aes(x=host_listings_count_total, y=host_acceptance_proportion)) +
  geom_point(color = "Orange", alpha = 0.3) + 
  xlab("Host Number of Listings") + 
  ylab("Host Acceptance Rate") + 
  ggtitle("Acceptance Rate vs Number of Listings")

# Print Scatterplot
acc_listings_scatter
```

**Takeaways:** While there is no clear linear trend, it seems that as the number of listings a host owns increases, the host acceptance rate also increases at a decreasing rate. In other words, the relationship could be seen as logarithmic. An explanation of this phenomena? Hosts that have more listings may be more responsible and thus will be most likely to close on a booking request.








# **Trends in Airbnb Listings**

This section focuses on qualities pertaining to a specific Airbnb Listing. Utilizing the available metrics provided by Inside Airbnb, I take a look at the pricing distributions of properties across locales and examine further quantities such as reviews per month, ratings, and property type. The heavily utilized variables include:

* `locale`: City/Area of listing
* `room_type`: The type of listing
* `latitude`: Latitude coordinate of listing
* `longitude`: Longitude coordinate of listing
* `reviews_per_month`: Average number of reviews per month of listing
* `price_per_night`: The sticker price per night of listing (For 1 night)
* `overall_rating`: The rating of the listing from 1 to 5

Why do these metrics matter? If you are considering listing a property in a locale, you probably want to know the general price per night other Airbnb hosts are charging. These are the types of questions this section aims to address.

There are a plethora of factors to consider in analyzing a listing, however here I focus on general trends for Airbnb listings

## **Strive for Reviews**

**Ratings vs Reviews**

**Method:** Using the `overall_rating variable` and `reviews_per_month` from my wrangled dataset,` all_listings`, I created a scatterplot to visualize any relationships between the number of reviews a listing receieves and the rating of the listing. The Rating scale ranges from **1** to **5**.

```{r Ratings vs Reviews Prep, include = FALSE}
# Pull needed vars
listing_scatter <- all_listings %>%
  select(listing_id,
         overall_rating,
         reviews_per_month,
         locale)
```

```{r Ratings vs Reviews Plot, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 3.5}
# Create Scatter plot
rating_rpm <- ggplot(listing_scatter, aes(x = reviews_per_month, y = overall_rating)) + 
  geom_point(col = "red", alpha = 0.2) + 
  xlab("Reviews Per Month") + 
  ylab("Overall Rating out of 5") + 
  ggtitle("Rating vs Reviews Per Month")

# Print plot
rating_rpm
```

**Takeaways:** This plot exhibits logarithmic growth in the listing's rating as the number of reviews per month increases. It is clear that listings that have few ratings can range from a rating of 1 to 5. However, as the number of reviews increases heavily, the listings exhibit ratings of 4 or greater. This is important to consider as a host because having a lot of good reviews may boost your listing's rating. 

## **Where Should I Go**

**Price Distribution Across Locales**

**Method:** Because each csv file from InsideAirbnb was downloaded by city, I included a new variable `locale` during the initial wrangling to keep track of which city the Airbnb listing is from. I also eliminated outliers that have values greater than 1.5 x the IQR (Interquartile Range). The following plot utilizes `geom_violin` from `ggplot`.

```{r Violin Plot Prep, include = FALSE}
# Grab Data only needed for violin plot
violin_data <- all_listings %>%
  select(price_per_night, locale)
  
# Convert locale variable to factor variable
violin_data$locale <- as.factor(violin_data$locale)

# Get rid of outliers
Q1 <- quantile(violin_data$price_per_night, .25)
Q3 <- quantile(violin_data$price_per_night, .75)
IQR <- IQR(violin_data$price_per_night)

no_outliers <- subset(violin_data, violin_data$price_per_night > (Q1 - 1.5*IQR) & violin_data$price_per_night < (Q3 + 1.5*IQR))

# Reorder locales by median price
no_outliers %>%
  mutate(locale = fct_reorder(locale, price_per_night, .fun="median"))
```

```{r Violin Plot, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}
# Create the violin plot
violin_plot <- ggplot(no_outliers, aes(x=reorder(locale, price_per_night), y=price_per_night, fill=locale)) + 
  geom_violin(trim=FALSE) +
  geom_boxplot(width=0.1, fill="white") + 
  labs(title="Pricing Distribution across Locales",x="Locale", y = "Price per Night") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())
  
# Print plot
violin_plot
```

**Takeaways:** I initially hypothesized that New York and San Fransico would have the greatest median price per night since they have higher costs of living. Contrary to my belief, locales like Hawaii, Nashville, and San Diego have considerably higher median prices than the other locales.

Grouping the locales by weather, it seems like warmer locales have higher median prices than colder locales like Chicago, New York, Denver. Could this be another indicator of the seasonality of running an Airbnb business? This is interesting because I thought the housing market and its projection of prices would be more closely reflected in the median Airbnb price per night across locales.


## **What Kind of Property**

**Treemap of Property Types**

**Method:** These pi-chart like graphs were generated utilizing the `treemap` package. This two level treemap is broken into two main categories. The General Shade of color represents the Locale while the specific shade of color represnets a subcategory of property type. All locales have 4 property types: Entire Home/Apt, Hotel Room, Private Room, Shared Room. The area of the box in the treemap represents the number of instances for that subcategory.


```{r Treemap Setup, include = FALSE}
# City Groupings
groupA = c(rep("Austin",4),rep("Boston",4),rep("Chicago",4),rep("Denver",4))
groupB = c(rep("Hawaii",4),rep("Los Angeles",4),rep("Nashville",4),rep("New Orleans",4))
groupC = c(rep("New York",4),rep("San Diego",4),rep("San Francisco",4),rep("Seattle",4))

# Sub categories of properties
subgroup = c("Entire home/apt","Hotel room","Private room","Shared room",
              "Entire home/apt","Hotel room","Private room","Shared room",
              "Entire home/apt","Hotel room","Private room","Shared room",
              "Entire home/apt","Hotel room","Private room","Shared room")

# Counts for each property type for each city
valueA = c(4295,6,683,60,
            806,16,553,5,
            2731,33,1060,54,
            1965,8,403,12)
valueB = c(12662,70,1128,22,
            10120,66,3785,248,
            3760,47,388,7,
            3219,17,416,12)
valueC = c(6961,108,5374,185,
            5350,7,1037,55,
            2061,44,1076,58,
            2086,453,16,0)

# Data frames for each tree map
treeA = data.frame(groupA,subgroup,valueA)
treeB = data.frame(groupB,subgroup,valueB)
treeC = data.frame(groupC,subgroup,valueC)
```

``` {r Treemap 1-4, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5 }
# Print Tree
treemap(treeA,
        index = c("groupA","subgroup"),
        vSize = "valueA",
        type = "index",
        border.col = c("black","white"),
        border.lwds = c(2,2),
        overlap.labels = 0,
        palette = "Set3",
        title = "Austin, Boston, Chicago, Denver")
```

``` {r Treemap 5-8, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5 }
# Print Tree
treemap(treeB,
        index = c("groupB","subgroup"),
        vSize = "valueB",
        type = "index",
        border.col = c("black","white"),
        border.lwds = c(2,2),
        overlap.labels = 0,
        palette = "Set2",
        title = "Hawaii, Los Angeles, Nashville, New Orleans")
```

``` {r Treemap 9-12, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5 }
# Print Tree
treemap(treeC,
        index = c("groupC","subgroup"),
        vSize = "valueC",
        type = "index",
        border.col = c("black","white"),
        border.lwds = c(2,2),
        overlap.labels = 0,
        palette = "Set3",
        title = "New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle")
```

**Takeaways:** There are multiple variables this treemap describes. Within a specific locale (general shade of color), we can see the distribution of property types. It seems that most locales have the majority of their properties as Entire home/apt. Private room takes a distanct second for most locales as well.

Comparing across Locales, we can see that large cities like New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston actually has a relatively large amount of Private rooms. Maybe this is what is driving the median price down.

In contrast, it seems like vacation locales like Hawaii, San Diego, have a smaller proportion of private rooms and shared rooms.

## **Listing Densities by Locale**

**Leaflet Map**

**Method:** The map object was created with the `leaflet` package. Leaflet allows users to easily generate maps by inputing a set of coordinates. Although leaflet is not compatible with ggmap (I think), I used the `addCircleMarkers` method to add points using the longitude/latitude coordinates provided for each listing in my dataset. 

```{r Shiny Map, out.extra="data-external=1", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7.5, out.width = "100%"}
# Embed shiny app
knitr::include_app("https://lokim21.shinyapps.io/mapShinyApp/", 
                   height = "700px")
